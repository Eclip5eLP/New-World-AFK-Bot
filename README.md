# New World AFK Bot

## Info

This Bot will open your chat and type things into your group chat to avoid being kicked.<br/>
This should be very hard to detect in contrast to other bots that just walk into a corner.<br/>

## How to use

Run ```python core.py``` in your terminal.<br/>
If you are on windows you can also just execute the ```run.bat``` file.<br/>
<br/>

## Settings

```
{
    "msgList": ["Yes", "No", "lol"],
    "waitTime": 120
}
```
<br/>

With ```msgList``` you can specify the words or phrases the bot will type into chat.<br/>
```waitTime``` specifies the time until a new message will be sent (in seconds).
